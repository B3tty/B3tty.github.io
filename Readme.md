## Personal Projects

Sometimes I like to build and experiment with stuff, for fun. Here are a few projects I worked on recently.

* [UserInfo](https://github.com/B3tty/UserInfo): A small API in C# with a few endpoints to register user activity on a website.
* [Kaggle](https://github.com/B3tty/Kaggle): A few experiments with Kaggle problems.
* [CodeJam](https://github.com/B3tty/CodeJam): Exercising on CodeJam past problems.


## WiMLDS Brown Bag Lunch sessions

These sessions are an initiative by the [WiMLDS Paris meetup group](https://www.meetup.com/Paris-Women-in-Machine-Learning-Data-Science). Each 3rd Thursday of the month, during lunchtime, we take the time to discuss Machine Learning and Data Science papers that we have found interesting. It's also a good opportunity to meet ML-passionate people in Paris.

I've been in charge of organizing them since September 2019 and I had the chance to organize 6 paper reading sessions so far.

You can find the papers that were presented, as well as the relevant presentations, on [this page](https://b3tty.github.io/BBL-WiMLDS).


## Presentations

I had a few occasions to present my work, at meetups and conferences. That activity is summed up [here](Presentations).
